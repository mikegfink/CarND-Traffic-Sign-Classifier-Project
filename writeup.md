### Data Set Summary & Exploration

#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I calculated summary statistics of the traffic signs data set by taking the length of the various collections and using the image.shape() method on a representative image:

Number of training examples = 34799
Number of validation examples = 4410
Number of testing examples = 12630
Image data shape = (32, 32, 3)
Number of classes = 43

#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It includes a sample image, as well as two histograms showing the number of images per class in the training and validation set.

### Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data.

As a first step, I decided to convert the images to HLS and back because I wanted to be able to vary the lightness for generating additional data.

While some papers have found grayscaling tends to improve accuracy, results were sufficient here so I foregoed that step.

Before normalizing, the data is shuffled to reduce any order dependence on the dataset.

As a last step, I normalized the image data in order to center the distribution of feature values. This can help to stabilize the gradients by preventing larger absolute valued parameter gradients from dominating.

I decided to generate additional data because I noticed some of the training images were very dark and that relevant images could be generated by varying the lightness because in the real world lighting can vary on the same sign. Of course, generic reasons for generating other additional data include providing resilience to variations like image position and orientation. I wanted to experiment with a less common generation and it appeared to provide a good improvement. 

To add more data to the the data set, I added two images per original image with lightness variations. This was done by adding and subtracting a constant lightness value from each pixel.

Here is an example of an original image and an augmented image:

The difference between the original data set and the augmented data set is the following ... 


#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x3 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 3x3     	| 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 28x28x36 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Dropout	      		| 50% dropout rate 								|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 14x14x54 				|
| Convolution 5x5	    | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 11x11x54	|
| RELU					|												|
| Dropout	      		| 50% dropout rate 								|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x54 					|
| Flatten				| outputs 1340x1								|
| Fully connected		| 1350->200    									|
| Fully connected		| 200->100    									|
| Fully connected		| 100->43    									|
| Softmax + L2 reg.		| Loss is softmax + L2 on the final two fully	|
|						| layers										|
|						|												|
 
This is based off the LeCun model we've been working with in the course. I increased the number of filters in the convolution layers to increase the number of parameters and predictive capability of the model. Interestingly, using very large numbers of filters tended to decrease the validation accuracy.

#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used an Adam optimizer, batch size of 128, 10 epochs and a 0.001 learning rate. In addition, the beta hyperparameter for controlling the influence of the L2 regularization was selected to be 0.01. These selections were mostly based on a "good enough" strategy for this project. The training did not take overly long, achieved sufficient results and let me explore various aspects of the code.

#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of ?
* validation set accuracy of 0.958 
* test set accuracy of ?

If an iterative approach was chosen:
* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?
The basic LeCun network adjusted to three channels for the inputs was the starting point. It was chosen as a known, simple, functional network to begin searching.

* What were some problems with the initial architecture?
The main problem appeared to be limited depth in the network to learn the features of all the classes. Both training and validation accuracy would plateau at lower accuracies than desired.

* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.
I experimented with a few variations, adding convolutional layers to the convolution stage, adding fully connected networks to the fully connected stage, removing some layers. I also experimented with changing the number of parameters, increasing the number of filters in the convolutional layers, increasing the neurons in the fully connected layers. For the most part, having too many parameters would reduce the accuracy within the time I was allowing for training. Also deviating from the LeCun architecture by small amounts would reduce the accuracy without exploring the hyper parameter space.

The most interesting variations, involved trying to reproduce the network where the output of the first convolutional network was fed both to the second convolutional layer and to the fully connected layers. The theory being to be able to give more value to the finer grained features in the network. I wasn't able to even match the original LeCun architecture's accuracy with this variation. I'm unsure if hyperparameter tuning could have resolved this problem as I didn't have time to fully explore the space.

I also added two forms of regularization, L2 loss regularization on the last two fully connected layers and dropout layers for the first two convolutional layers. These were added to prevent overfitting of the network.

In the end, marginally increasing the size of the network was the most successful adjustment. This, the regularization and the some generated data achieved the target accuracy rate.

* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?
I experimented with the learning rate, batch size, number of epochs and regularization rate. In the end, I left most of the parameters as suggested in the course lab. The regularization rate, beta, ended up at the value suggested by blog posts on L2 regularization.

* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?

If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?
I didn't go towards a well known architecture like AlexNet in order to get a better understanding of playing with layers and parameters.

### Test a Model on New Images

#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![Traffic Sign 1][image3] ![Traffic Sign 2][image4] ![Traffic Sign 3][image5] 
![Traffic Sign 4][image6] ![Traffic Sign 5][image7]

The first image might be difficult to classify because it is an electronic speed limit sign that has the colors inverted from the typical white background and black text.

The second image ought not to be difficult to classify. Problems could arise if the network struggles with identifying numbers, or if positional variations are an issue insufficiently trained by the data set. I decided not to augment the dataset with minor positional variations, and an error here plausibly could be remedied by more samples.

The third image could be difficult to classify if the details of the stripes are important. When downsampling to 32 by 32 pixels, the stripes will likely be blurred. In general, this sign should be straightforward.

The fourth image should also not be difficult to classify. If I had greyscaled the image, then perhaps there could be difficulty as the yellow color is a major feature.

The last image could be difficult to classify because the image will need to be upsampled to 32 by 32. On the other hand, it ought to be a simple pattern to process, so I do not expect there to be difficulties.

#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Speed Limit 120kph	| Speed Limit 60 kph							| 
| Speed Limit 30 kph	| Speed Limit 50 kph 							|
| End speed limits		| End speed limits								|
| Priority road	  		| Priority road					 				|
| No entry				| No entry 		     							|


The model was able to correctly guess 3 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 60%. This compares very poorly to the accuracy on the test set. This is entirely a result of trying to identify the numbers in the speed limit signs. The 120kph sign was intentionally chosen to be challenging as it is an electronic sign, which likely isn't present in the training set. It's colors are swapped, with a black background and white writing. This could be addressed by color inverting appropriate signs during training so the network can learn to ignore the color. For the 30kph sign, the network's second choice was the correct sign, but it clearly should have classified this sign correctly. Again, perhaps more samples for the speeds are needed to improve the ability of the network to differentiate between them.

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the Predict the Sign Type for Each Image cell of the Ipython notebook.

For all of the images, the model is 100% sure when considering the softmax because the logit values are very high in absolute value. As a result, the softmax isn't particularly interesting because it is doing too good of a job approximating argmax. If we scaled the logits down, then applied softmax, or just looked at the raw logit values, we can draw some conclusions about what's going on.

For the first speed limit sign, the logit values were rather close together and the 4 of the top 5 probabilities were speed limit signs. This makes sense, as electronic signs were probably not included in the training set and so was probably an edge case for the network. For the 30kph speed limit, the correct choice had the second highest probability, but it was not as close as for the 120kph sign. Since 3s and 5s are very close, and the number of pixels available to differentiate the two is very small, this error is understandable, though not acceptable. As mentioned, more training, or perhaps more parameters are needed.

The correctly predicted signs were not as interesting, though the "No entry" sign's logits were relatively close together. This sign also had to be upscaled from the image I found, so that may have had to do with the network's relative lack of certainty.

Sign 1: 120kph 3, 29,  2,  1,  5

| Probability/Raw      	|     Prediction	        					|
